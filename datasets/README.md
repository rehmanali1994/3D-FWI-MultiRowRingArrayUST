At the end of [kWaveSimLauncher.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/kWaveSimLauncher.m), the function call to [AssembleSimData.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/AssembleSimData.m) assembles the simulated data from each indivdual transmit/MAT-file in the [Simulations/sim_data](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/tree/main/sim_data) folder into a single MAT file (either _LeftBreastMRI.mat_ or _RightBreastMRI.mat_) containing the 3D UST dataset needed for FWI in this folder (the [datasets](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/tree/main/datasets) folder).  Note that the complete time-series data is too large to store in a single file for the full 3D dataset.  Instead, we extract only the frequencies listed in [kWaveSimLauncher.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/kWaveSimLauncher.m) to keep the file size for the full 3D dataset small.
