# 3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST
3D Full-Waveform Inversion for a Multi-Row Ring-Array UST System SImulated in k-Wave

Ultrasound tomography (UST) is a medical imaging system that uses the transmission of ultrasound through tissue to create images of the speed of sound.  Currently, UST is based on a single-row elevation-focused ring-array transducer.  This ring-array is translated vertically to reconstruct a series of 2D slices that are assembled into a 3D volume.  The main algorithm used to reconstruct these 2D slices is 2D frequency-domain full-waveform inversion (FWI): see our previous work on 2D slice-wise FWI ([rehmanali1994/WaveformInversionUST](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/WaveformInversionUST)).  

In this work, we extend the ring-array geometry to multiple rows of elements.  By emitting cylindrical wave transmits from this multi-row ring array, we can keep the number of transmisssions to a minimum while still capturing the full 3D insonification needed to reconstruct the full volume.  With this imaging geometry, 2D FWI can be applied to each row of receive elements to reconstruct an image slice for each row.  Here, we compare 3D FWI to 2D slicewise FWI in numerical breast phantoms.  

We provide sample data and algorithms presented in

# k-Wave Simulation

The code used to run the [k-Wave](http://www.k-wave.org/) simulation involves a 3-step process:

1) [GenKWaveSimInfoFromMRI.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/GenKWaveSimInfoFromMRI.m) creates a MAT file that is stored in the [sim_info](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/tree/main/sim_info) folder. This MAT file contains all the information (medium, multi-row ring array geometry, and pulse excitation) needed to simulate the UST system. [GenKWaveSimInfoFromMRI.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/GenKWaveSimInfoFromMRI.m) uses [sampled_cylinder.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/phantoms/sampled_cylinder.m) to create the multi-row ring-array transducer and [BreastPhantomVolumetricMRI.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/phantoms/BreastPhantomVolumetricMRI.m) to produce the material properties used in the simulation. [BreastPhantomVolumetricMRI.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/phantoms/BreastPhantomVolumetricMRI.m) relies on the BreastPhantomFromMRI.mat found under the [releases](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/releases) tab.  Please place BreastPhantomFromMRI.mat into the [phantoms](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/tree/main/phantoms) folder.  Note that [GenKWaveSimInfoFromMRI.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/GenKWaveSimInfoFromMRI.m) can run two different simulations: one corresponding to the left breast (`leftBreast = true`) and the other corresponding to the right breast (`leftBreast = false`).  This option can be passed into [BreastPhantomVolumetricMRI.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/3D-FWI-MultiRowRingArrayUST/blob/main/phantoms/BreastPhantomVolumetricMRI.m) function.


2) After generating the MAT file in [Simulations/sim_info](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/tree/main/Simulations/sim_info), we run the actual [k-Wave](http://www.k-wave.org/) simulation using [GenRFDataSingleTxKWave.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/blob/main/Simulations/GenRFDataSingleTxKWave.m). [GenRFDataSingleTxKWave.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/blob/main/Simulations/GenRFDataSingleTxKWave.m) loops through each single-element transmit. The simulated data for each transmit is then stored in MAT files in the [Simulations/scratch](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/tree/main/Simulations/scratch) folder.
3) Lastly, [AssembleUSCTChannelData.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/blob/main/Simulations/AssembleUSCTChannelData.m) assembles the simulated data from each indivdual transmit/MAT-file in the [Simulations/scratch](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/tree/main/Simulations/scratch) folder into a single MAT file _kWave_SheppLogan.mat_ containing the full UST dataset in the [Simulations/datasets](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/tree/main/Simulations/datasets) folder.
